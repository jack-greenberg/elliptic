This is because we decrease the number to fit in $\text{mod } p$, and if we set $p$ to a set number of bits, any $\text{mod }p$ calculation will be less than that number of bits.</p></section></section><section><h1 id=group-theory>Group Theory</h1></section><section><h2 id=abelian-groups>Abelian Groups</h2><p>An <em>abelian group</em> is defined by a set $E$ together with a an operation $\bullet$.
