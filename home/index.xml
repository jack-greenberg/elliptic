If a computation on any two elements in this set were to land outside of this range under normal circumstances, it would instead wrap back around to the other end.
Let's see an example 🔽
Example Let&amp;rsquo;s say we are working in $\text{mod } 7$.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://example.org/home/groups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/home/groups/</guid><description>Group Theory Abelian Groups An abelian group is defined by a set $E$ together with a an operation $\bullet$. This operation combines two elements $a,b \in E$. Abelian groups follow five other axioms&amp;hellip;
Axioms Closure: If $a, b \in E$ then $a \bullet b \in E$.
Commutativity: For all $a, b \in E$, $a \bullet b = b \bullet a$.
Associativity: For all $a, b, c \in E$, $(a \bullet b) \bullet c = a \bullet (b \bullet c)$.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://example.org/home/curves/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/home/curves/</guid><description>Elliptic Curves An Elliptic Curve is a smooth, algebraic curve given by an equation of the form
$$y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$$
Montgomery and Weierstrass The equations we&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at are in Weierstrass form:
$$y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$$
There is an alternative form of elliptic curves called Montgomery curves that are of the form:
$$y^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 + x$$
Uses One of the major uses of Elliptic Curves is Cryptography.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://example.org/home/security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/home/security/</guid><description>Security Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Relies on a couple of steps with secret and public values:
2 public values (base and mod) 2 private personal keys 2 public keys 1 private shared key How does it work? Lets say Alice and Bob want to exchange information by encrypting it using the D-H key exchange method:
We are going visualize these as colors in a paint can to see how they each use they keys, but take into account these are integers in real life, and they are normally extremely big.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://example.org/home/conclusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/home/conclusion/</guid><description>Tying it together You may be asking now that we have gone through all of this, how exactly do all these components relate and work together?
ECC &amp;amp; D-H Key Exchange We know that from D-H Key Exchange both parties can get a private key, known only to the people communicating. We call this key &amp;ldquo;K&amp;rdquo;.
We also saw how, if we have a starting point P in a curve, we can, through point operation, to another point in the same curve.</description></item></channel></rss>
