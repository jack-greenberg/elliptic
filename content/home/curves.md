There are two parameters to elliptic curves:

<br>

$A$ &nbsp; and &nbsp; $B$

### Examples

__Bitcoin__ uses a curve called [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1). The curve looks like

$$y^2 = x^3 + 7$$

<br>

Many major messaging services including __Whatsapp__ and __Signal__ use a curve called X25519.
The equation of the curve is too big to show here.
